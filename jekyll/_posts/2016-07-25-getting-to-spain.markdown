Leonardo Da Vinci Airport

The security line at Rome Fiumicino felt a little like being backstage at the ballet dress rehearsals I used to go to when daughter was 3.  In spite of very detailed, almost by-the-minute- instruction with an undertone of shame if not followed, it really just ends up being a total shit show of shoes, bags, being one step ahead of a melt down, people talking with their hands a lot, and at completion, an inability to curtail your legs from power walking you to the nearest bar.  While I questioned whether some people had ever been in an airport security line, there were other people I was sure had just never been in any kind of line at all. With all the traveling we had done so far, this felt like a test of airport skill. Part logistical, part multitasking, with an element of Zen mastery â€“ our kids proved again they were all stars. And then, like shoes in the airport security line, we were off.
