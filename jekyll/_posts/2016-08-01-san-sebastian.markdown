After missing our flight to Madrid, and touring the Barcelona airport from top to bottom, we arrived at the bus station in San Sebastian at about 12:30 am.  Over the years, San Sebastian has become somewhat mythical.  Since Jeremy lived there in college I have heard so much about it over the years – how beautiful it is, how much we would love it, yadeeyadeeyadah.  Arriving in the pitch dark, it felt like the moments before you find out what is included in the show case show down – It could be a new car and trip around the world, or it could be, like, an ATV or house boat trip.  I mean, either way super awesome, but people just like different things, ya know? In the morning I was thrilled to find out I would not be needing to employ the super-excited-yet-really-disappointed facial expression I seen on so many sick days at my grandparents house. San Sebastian is the kind of amazing that makes contestants nearly make out with Bob Barker.  The cultural capital of Europe, it has the sophistication of a big European city - architecture, art and history; with the laid back feel of a secluded beach town that has surfable waves. I felt like we had found our Prom queen.  And the first morning, Jeremy, walking in the door with coffee and my first tortilla de patata, secured his title of Prom King (cheesiest line I have ever thought of so had to do it).

It was a perfect beach day - sunny, warm water, perfect sand and room to play soccer.  There were also boobs. Lots of boobs.  At first the curiosity factor of the kids was similar to a kitten chasing a laser pointer, but by the end of the trip we had for the most part grown accustom to the more naked way of beach going and towel changes had fallen by the wayside so to speak.  With the exception of Ingrid that is, who responded to efforts to speed up the changing process of ditching the towel with “but I’m American.” Point made, I guess.
