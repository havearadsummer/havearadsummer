After crazy jet lag and the news of what happened in Nice, Vernazza was a place whose beauty almost seemed obnoxious and sarcastic.  Either that or we were just beyond turned in to the beauty of life after all the reports of horror.  

Like the birth of fricken Venus the kids emerged from their jet lagged shells to be their normal crazy-silly selves.  Obsessed with finding soccer jerseys and "rompers" in a city that is known more for its raw seaside feast of the senses than it's consumerist delights the kids were a little horrified.  Their disappointment was short lived as we took to playing the very complicated game of throw-a-rock-and-get-it-to-stay-on-the-other-rock game.  Happiness all around.

After a much needed nights sleep we were up and ready to explore a different town.  We headed to Monterosso al Mare and upon arriving immediately regretted not coming fully prepared for a full beach day.  The beach was beautiful with beach chairs and typical Italian beach umbrellas, the water was clear and crisp and the views just beautiful.  Worth the 20 euros for two chairs.  Swimming out to rocks and laying in the sun made for a perfect beach day topped off with Gelato.
