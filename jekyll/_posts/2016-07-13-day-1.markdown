It's a good thing people stay out late here cause we are sleeping right on through this day.  We arrived in Nice late last night and while Jeremy and I were ready to sleep our kids were, lets just say...not.

While Jeremy and I went in and out of sleep - the out parts dominated by beseeching our children to "close their eyes!" and "stay on your own side of the bed!" - Ingrid led the nocturnal life with what appears at first glance to be two outfit changes, a dance party in the bed, at least a slice of pizza and some experimenting with the bidet.  Once she finally fell asleep, Noah was up and, after watching some Scooby Doo found a french language show about gem stones and diamonds followed by what I think was a Korean show about whale sharks?? Language barrier be damned!  We finally dozed off to some classical music led by a conductor with mime-level facial expressions. And while they are asleep at last, and while I am also mourning the loss of our "breakfast included" I am also looking forward to getting out and exploring what I am sure behind the blackout curtains is a beautiful place with these 1/2 zombie children.
